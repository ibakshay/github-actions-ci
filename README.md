GitHub actions is first introduced as a  beta version a year ago and there are already some awesome actions like [automatic-rebase](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/automatic-rebase), [post-slack-message](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/post-slack-message) availabe in the [GitHub MarketPlace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions). Actions are just automated Script which can be  triggered  based on any GitHub event. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ibakshay/github-actions-ci/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ibakshay/github-actions-ci/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
