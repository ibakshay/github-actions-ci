`GitHub Actions` is a feature introduced last year and there are already lot of  awesome actions like [automatic-rebase](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/automatic-rebase), [post-slack-message](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/post-slack-message) availabe in the [GitHub MarketPlace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions). GitHub  Actions are just automated scripts managed and run by GitHub, orchestating any workflow  and  can be triggered  based on any [GitHub event](https://developer.github.com/actions/managing-workflows/workflow-configuration-options/#events-supported-in-workflow-files).

Last week, GitHub has introduced beta of GitHub Actions Version 2 with fully integrated Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) support. I was very excited to try this new feature and I have implemented the GitHub Actions CI for the forked open-source project [CLA Assistant](https://github.com/ibakshay/cla-assistant).  In this post, I will you show you how easy It is to get started with Github Actions for CI. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ibakshay/github-actions-ci/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ibakshay/github-actions-ci/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
